### Step-by-Step Guide: Git Workflow for a Team Project

#### **Scenario Overview**:
The team is developing a web application. The goal is to enable multiple developers to work on features simultaneously while maintaining a stable `main` branch. This guide ensures:
- Smooth collaboration
- High code quality
- Automated integration testing

---

### **Git Workflow Guide**

#### **1. Setting Up the Repository**
1. **Create the Repository**: If not already done, create a repository in GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket. Set `main` as the default branch. Enable branch protection rules for the `main` branch to: require pull requests for merging and enable status checks (e.g., automated testing) before merging.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Each developer clones the repository to their local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
   ```

#### **2. Branching Strategy**
1. **Use a Feature Branching Model**: All work is done in separate branches based on the `main` branch. Naming convention for branches: **Feature branch**: `feature/<description>`, **Bugfix branch**: `bugfix/<description>`, **Enhancement branch**: `enhancement/<description>`.
2. **Create a Feature Branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main        # Switch to the main branch
   git pull origin main     # Ensure it's up-to-date
   git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>  # Create and switch to the feature branch
   ```

#### **3. Implementing Features**
1. Make your changes in the feature branch. 
2. Stage and commit changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add: <description of the changes>"
   ```
3. Push the branch to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/<feature-name>
   ```

#### **4. Code Reviews with Pull Requests**
1. **Submit a Pull Request**: Go to the repository on GitHub/GitLab. Open a Pull Request (PR) from your feature branch to the `main` branch. Add a descriptive title and summary: what the feature does and steps to test it. Assign reviewers to the PR.
2. **Conduct the Code Review**: Reviewers check for: code quality, readability, and adherence to standards; any potential issues or bugs. Provide feedback, suggest changes, or approve the PR.

#### **5. Continuous Integration (CI) Testing**
1. **Automated Tests**: Set up CI pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CircleCI) to run tests for every pull request. Typical tests include: linting for code style checks, unit tests to verify the functionality of individual components, and integration tests to ensure new changes donâ€™t break existing code.
2. Ensure the PR passes all automated tests before approval.

#### **6. Merging into `main`**
1. Once the PR is approved and tests pass: merge the branch into `main` via the PR interface using "Squash and Merge" or "Rebase and Merge." Ensure the branch is deleted after merging to keep the repository clean.
2. If merging manually:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main      # Ensure main is up-to-date
   git merge feature/<feature-name>
   git push origin main
   ```

#### **7. Keeping Feature Branches Updated**
1. Regularly rebase the feature branch with `main` to avoid conflicts:
   ```bash
   git checkout feature/<feature-name>
   git pull --rebase origin main
   git push origin feature/<feature-name> --force
   ```

### **Best Practices**
1. **Collaborative Development**: Keep PRs small and focused on a single feature or fix. Use descriptive commit messages.
2. **Avoid Merge Conflicts**: Regularly sync feature branches with `main`.
3. **Protect the `main` Branch**: Only allow merging via PRs. Require tests to pass before merging.
4. **Maintain Clean History**: Use rebase instead of merge during development to keep the Git history linear and easy to read.

### **How This Workflow Facilitates Collaboration**
- **Parallel Development**: Feature branches allow multiple developers to work independently.
- **Code Quality**: Code reviews ensure every change is vetted before merging.
- **Automation**: CI pipelines catch bugs early through automated testing.
- **Stable `main` Branch**: Ensures only tested and reviewed code reaches production.
